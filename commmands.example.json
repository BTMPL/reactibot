They may not actually be online, they may not be able to help, and they may be in a completely different timezone–nobody likes push notifications at 3am from an impatient stranger. Similarly, don’t DM other members without asking first. All of the same problems as @-mentioning apply, and private conversations can’t help anyone else. Your questions are likely not unique, and other people can learn from them when they’re kept public.",
